# a7-TestDrivenDevelopmentOnCustomArrayList
1.Application - getSize after add(2, 1212) still gives 21 items, even though add(index, item) extends the array 
2.List - sysout in the add(int index, T item) gives 22, with 19 null - probably because of items.length * 2?
3.Test - gives error - expected 22 was 0 ?
